    <h1>Creating displays</h1>
    Worked under supervision of Brian Barsky https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/barsky.html on evaluating
    various simulation methods for deciding the types of display to use for phones. Such displays should allow users with eye
    deficiencies to read without glasses. My work focused on creating an accurate methodology for the simulation and evaluating existing
    simulations.
