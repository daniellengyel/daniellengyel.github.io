<p>Hi! I am Daniel Lengyel.</p>

<p>Currently I am a third year PhD student at Imperial College London in the Department of Computing, superivsed by Nicholas R. Jennings, Panos Parpas and Nikolas Kantas. I am interested in systems involving interaction. Topics I have worked on include derivative free optimization, distributed optimization and data sparsification.</p>

<p>Prior to my PhD, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in math and computer science at UC Berkeley. There I spent significant time in the RISELab working on distributed optimization and model predictive control of HVAC systems for commercial buildings accross California to reduce energy consumption. I also dedicated my time to interests in quantum computing and energy and resources.</p>
