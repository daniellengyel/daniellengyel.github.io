# About page

Hi! I am Daniel Lengyel. 

Currently I am a third year PhD student at Imperial College London in the Department of Computing, superivsed by Nicholas R. Jennings, Panos Parpas and Nikolas Kantas. I am interested in systems involving interaction. Topics I have worked on include derivative free optimization, distributed optimization and data sparsification. 

Prior to my PhD, I obtained my bachelor's degree in math and computer science at UC Berkeley. There I spent significant time in the RISELab working on distributed optimization and model predictive control of HVAC systems for commercial buildings accross California to reduce energy consumption. I also dedicated my time to interests in quantum computing and energy and resources.
